# Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that is primarily used for web development. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages, enhancing the user experience. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of JavaScript, including its syntax, data types, functions, and how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich. It is an essential part of web development, alongside HTML and CSS. While HTML provides the structure of a web page and CSS handles the styling, JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

Learning JavaScript opens up a world of opportunities for developers. Here are a few reasons why you should consider learning JavaScript:

1. **Widely Used**: JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used by millions of developers and is supported by all modern web browsers.

2. **Versatile**: JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development. With the advent of Node.js, developers can use JavaScript to build server-side applications as well.

3. **Rich Ecosystem**: The JavaScript ecosystem is vast, with numerous libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js that simplify development and enhance productivity.

4. **Strong Community**: The JavaScript community is large and active, providing a wealth of resources, tutorials, and forums for developers to learn and share knowledge.

## Getting Started with JavaScript

To start coding in JavaScript, you need a text editor and a web browser. You can use any text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad. For the browser, Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari are great options.

### Your First JavaScript Program

Let's write a simple JavaScript program that displays a message in the console. Open your text editor and create a new file named `script.js`. Add the following code:

```javascript showLineNumbers
console.log("Hello, World!");
